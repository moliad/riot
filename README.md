riot - Rebol Integrated and Open Tools
====



This is a repository to share and collaborate on Rebol integrated development tools.

The repository currently has a few IDE tools plus a dis-organised set of odds and ends
to build, test and demonstrate Rebol itself and a few of the libraries I have in other repositories.
