Steel - Rebol Open Development Tools
====

This is a repository to share and collaborate on Rebol integrated development tools.

The repository currently has a few IDE tools plus a dis-organised set of odds and ends
to build, test and demonstrate Rebol itself and a few of the libraries I have in other repositories.

The project content and organisation will most definitely change in time (maybe even its name).
For now its mainly a question of sharing useful code in a centralized spot.

Note that it's entirely possible that some code here, may be extracted to its own repository
if it proves easier to manage and the user base asks for it.

Eventually I'll integrate some of the tools together within a unified application framework I am designing.
